Yearly mean total sunspot number (1610-now):
New file: GN_y_tot_V2.0.txt, GN_y_tot_V2.0.csv (CSV format)
Contents: decimal year, GNvalue , GNerror, Nb observations

Our other data products (EISN: daily estimated sunspot number, 12-month forecasts) have been adapted to match the scale of the main sunspot time series, but the file names and formats remain unchanged.

Next to the Sunspot Number data, we now also distribute the Group Number time series, which extends futher back to 1610. A new dedicated section includes the original series (Hoyt and Schatten 1998) and new revised versions. As these are research products, those series cover a fixed time interval, and are not updated and extended on a monthly basis like the Sunspot Number.
